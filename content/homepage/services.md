##### BET:

###### BET Analysis:
PlasmaChem GmbH offers you a chance to benefit from PlasmaChem´s experience in particle characterization by providing you with a material characterization service for your samples. Samples will be analysed on the last generation BET surface analyser Belsorp-Mini. Nitrogen gas is applied to this technique, which is essentially volumetric in nature. Analysis is undertaken as a most accurate multipoint BET area measurement.

In order to obtain the most accurate results it is normally necessary to degas samples prior to testing and PlasmaChem can accommodate a wide range of conditions for this purpose. Furthermore, these may be combined to suit the individual requirements of our customers. Degassing temperatures up to 300°C under vacuum and flowing nitrogen gas can be applied.

Besides of the surface area measurements, PlasmaChem can also analyse micro- and mesoporous particles providing valuble information about volume and size distribution of the pores in the material. 

Results are generally emailed as PDF files to speed up transmission to the client and include the BET area plot together with tabulated data and the calculated surface area of the sample. In addition, we offer assistance with interpretation of results at no extra charge. Surface area, or specific surface area, is a critical factor influencing the operation and behaviour of many materials. It is often applicable to such issues as the determination of stability and the efficiency of most materials, including catalysts and pharmaceuticals. The measurement of surface area also provides a critical measurement for quality control of many materials.
